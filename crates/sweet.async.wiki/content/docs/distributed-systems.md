# Building Distributed Systems

Sweet Async makes building distributed systems elegant with its composable orchestration patterns.

## Key Concepts

- **Orchestrator as AsyncTask**: Every component is composable
- **Zero-copy message passing**: Efficient inter-node communication
- **Automatic retries and fallbacks**: Built-in resilience
- **Structured concurrency**: Predictable resource management

```rust
let distributed_task = AsyncTask::to::<DistributedCompute>({
    Cluster::new()
        .add_node("compute-1", node1_config)
        .add_node("compute-2", node2_config)
        .with_load_balancer(RoundRobin)
        .with_health_checks(interval_5s)
})
.with_retry(exponential_backoff())
.with_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
.await?;
```
