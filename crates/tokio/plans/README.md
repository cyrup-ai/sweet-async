# Sweet Async Tokio Implementation Plans

![Sweet Async Logo](/assets/sweet_async.png)

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for completing the Tokio implementation of Sweet Async. These plans serve as a comprehensive guide for developers working on the implementation.

## Plan Documents

- **[Implementation Overview](implementation_overview.md)** - High-level overview of the implementation approach and structure
- **[Builder Pattern PR](builder_pattern_pr.md)** - Detailed plan for implementing the builder pattern
- **[AsyncTask Completion PR](async_task_completion_pr.md)** - Plan for completing the AsyncTask implementation
- **[Event Processing PR](event_processing_pr.md)** - Plan for implementing the event processing system
- **[Implementation Roadmap](implementation_roadmap.md)** - Timeline and priorities for the implementation process

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the Tokio crate:

1. Review the [Implementation Overview](implementation_overview.md) to understand the big picture
2. Start with the [Builder Pattern PR](builder_pattern_pr.md), which provides the foundation
3. Follow the implementation sequence outlined in the plans
4. Use the provided code examples as a reference for your implementation
5. Ensure all tests pass before moving to the next component

## Implementation Principles

When implementing the Tokio crate, follow these key principles:

1. **API Compatibility**: Don't modify the API crate - implement to match the existing API
2. **Immutability**: Follow the immutable builder pattern throughout
3. **Type Safety**: Maintain strong typing and proper generic constraints
4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure concurrency safety with proper synchronization
5. **Clean Code**: Follow Rust best practices and maintain high code quality

## Testing Strategy

Each component should be thoroughly tested:

- Unit tests for individual functions and methods
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Property tests for invariants and contracts
- Performance tests for critical paths

## Contributing

When working on the implementation:

1. Create a branch for each PR (e.g., `tokio-builder-pattern`)
2. Follow the implementation plan for that component
3. Add comprehensive tests as you go
4. Document all public APIs
5. Submit a PR for review when complete

## Visual Overview

The implementation plan follows a dependency structure:

```
Builder Pattern PR (foundation)
        │
        ▼
AsyncTask Completion PR (task relationships)
        │
        ▼
Event Processing PR (streaming capability)
```
