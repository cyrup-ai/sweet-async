# Sweet Async Tokio Implementation Plans

![Sweet Async Logo](/assets/sweet_async.png)

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for completing the Tokio implementation of the Sweet Async API. Each document outlines a specific component that needs to be implemented, along with detailed guidance on how to approach the implementation.

## Overview

The Sweet Async API provides an immutable, fluent builder for orchestrating asynchronous work with powerful abstractions for complex async workflows. The current Tokio implementation is partially complete, with several key components missing or stubbed out. These implementation plans provide a roadmap for completing the implementation to fully match the API specification.

## Implementation Tracks

Each implementation track has its own plan document:

1. [**Builder Pattern Implementation**](./builder_implementation.md)
   - Implementing the immutable builder pattern for Tokio tasks
   - Creating builders for both future-based and event-based tasks
   - Integrating builders with the Tokio runtime and orchestrator

2. [**AsyncTask Implementation Completion**](./async_task_completion.md)
   - Completing the static methods in the AsyncTask trait
   - Implementing OrchestratorBuilder for different task types
   - Finishing the SpawningTask trait implementation

3. [**Parent-Child Relationship Implementation**](./parent_child_implementation.md)
   - Properly implementing the ContextualizedTask trait
   - Adding child task tracking and management
   - Implementing cancellation propagation for task hierarchies

4. [**Task Chain Implementation**](./task_chain_implementation.md)
   - Implementing the `chain()` method for task composition
   - Creating task chain structures and Future implementations
   - Supporting different chaining patterns and error handling

5. [**Event Processing Implementation**](./event_processing_implementation.md)
   - Adding event-based task execution with streaming
   - Implementing different processing strategies
   - Creating event collectors and channel mechanisms

## Implementation Approach

Each component should be implemented with these principles in mind:

1. **API Compatibility**: Do not modify the API crate; ensure the implementation matches the existing API contracts.

2. **Immutability**: Follow the immutable builder pattern used throughout the API.

3. **Type Safety**: Maintain strong typing and proper generic parameter handling.

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all implementations are thread-safe and work properly in concurrent environments.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and propagation.

## Dependencies Between Components

The implementation components have dependencies that suggest an optimal implementation order:

1. **Builder Pattern** - Foundation for task creation
2. **AsyncTask Completion** - Core task abstraction
3. **Parent-Child Relationships** - Task hierarchy support
4. **Task Chaining** - Task composition capability
5. **Event Processing** - Stream-based task execution

While there are dependencies, many components can be implemented in parallel by different teams, with appropriate coordination.

## Testing

Each component should include comprehensive tests covering:

- Basic functionality and API compatibility
- Edge cases and error handling
- Performance characteristics
- Integration with other components

## Documentation

As each component is implemented, documentation should be updated to include:

- API documentation with examples
- Integration guides
- Performance considerations
- Design rationales

## Conclusion

Completing these implementations will result in a full-featured Tokio implementation of the Sweet Async API, offering both future-based and stream-based task execution with the same ergonomic interface as specified in the API.
