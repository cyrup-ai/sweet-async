# Sweet Async Tokio Implementation Overview

![Sweet Async Logo](/assets/sweet_async.png)

This document provides an overview of the implementation plans for completing the Tokio implementation of Sweet Async.

## Current State

The Tokio implementation is partially complete, with several core components already implemented but missing some key features:

- ✅ Basic `AsyncTask` implementation
- ✅ Basic `TokioRuntime` implementation
- ✅ Basic `TokioOrchestrator` implementation
- ✅ Adaptive concurrency utilities
- ❌ Builder pattern implementation (missing)
- ❌ Complete AsyncTask trait implementation (partial)
- ❌ Parent-child relationship implementation (stubbed)
- ❌ Task chaining (missing)
- ❌ Event processing system (missing)

## Implementation Plan Structure

We've divided the implementation into three major PRs, each building on the previous:

1. **[Builder Pattern PR](builder_pattern_pr.md)** - The foundational PR that implements the builder pattern
2. **[AsyncTask Completion PR](async_task_completion_pr.md)** - Completes the AsyncTask implementation with parent-child relationships and task chaining
3. **[Event Processing PR](event_processing_pr.md)** - Implements the event-based processing system

Each PR document provides detailed implementation guidance including:
- Files to create or modify
- Code examples for each implementation
- Tests to validate the implementation
- Notes on potential issues and considerations

## PR Sequence and Dependencies

The PRs should be implemented in sequence, as each builds on the previous:

```
Builder Pattern PR → AsyncTask Completion PR → Event Processing PR
```

### 1. Builder Pattern PR

This PR focuses on implementing the builder pattern for the Tokio implementation, which is central to the API's design. It includes:

- Base `AsyncTaskBuilder` implementation
- `TokioSpawningTaskBuilder` for future-based tasks
- Static methods for task creation
- Convenience functions

### 2. AsyncTask Completion PR

This PR builds on the builder foundation to complete the AsyncTask implementation, focusing on:

- Parent-child relationships
- Task context management
- Task chaining
- Cancellation propagation

### 3. Event Processing PR

The final PR implements the event processing system, including:

- Event types and collectors
- Processing strategies (serial, parallel, batched, adaptive)
- Event channels and flow control
- Emitting task builder

## Implementation Approach

For each component, the implementation follows these principles:

1. **API Compatibility**: Maintain strict compatibility with the API crate
2. **Immutability**: Follow the immutable builder pattern throughout
3. **Type Safety**: Ensure strong typing and proper generics
4. **Thread Safety**: Implement proper synchronization for concurrent use
5. **Testing**: Include comprehensive tests for each component

## Conclusion

By following these implementation plans, we'll create a complete, high-quality Tokio implementation of the Sweet Async API that provides users with a powerful, ergonomic interface for asynchronous programming.
