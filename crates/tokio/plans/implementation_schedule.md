## Implementation Milestones

| Milestone | Description | Estimated Completion |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| 0.1.0 | Core task infrastructure (already done) | Complete |
| 0.2.0 | Builder pattern implementation | Week 2 |
| 0.3.0 | AsyncTask and parent-child completion | Week 4 |
| 0.4.0 | Event processing system | Week 7 |
| 0.5.0 | Performance optimization | Week 9 |
| 1.0.0 | Complete implementation with documentation | Week 10 |

## Progress Tracking

We'll use GitHub issues and milestones to track progress on each component:

1. Create issues for each major task
2. Group issues into milestone corresponding to the phases above
3. Update the TASKLIST.md file as components are completed
4. Hold weekly check-ins to assess progress and adjust the schedule

## Resource Allocation

To optimize the implementation process, we recommend:

1. **One Lead Developer** responsible for overall architecture and API compatibility
2. **1-2 Additional Developers** to work on specific components in parallel
3. **1 Reviewer** to ensure code quality and API compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

Potential implementation challenges:

1. **API Compatibility**: Regular validation against API traits
2. **Complex Generic Constraints**: Start with simple cases, then expand
3. **Thread Safety**: Comprehensive testing with race condition checkers
4. **Performance**: Early benchmarking of critical paths
