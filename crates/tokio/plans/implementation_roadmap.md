# Sweet Async Tokio Implementation Roadmap

![Sweet Async Logo](/assets/sweet_async.png)

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for completing the Tokio implementation of Sweet Async, based on our analysis of the current codebase and compilation issues.

## Current Status

The Tokio implementation of Sweet Async is partially complete but has several issues:

1. Compilation errors related to importing private modules
2. Missing implementations of key traits and methods
3. Type mismatches between the API and implementation
4. Stubbed methods that need complete implementation

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Fix Build Issues

Before we can proceed with completing the implementation, we need to fix the build issues:

1. **Fix Import Issues**
   - Update imports to use public re-exports from the API crate
   - Replace private module imports with proper public paths
   - Add missing imports for traits being used

2. **Resolve Type Compatibility Issues**
   - Fix method signatures to match the API trait definitions
   - Ensure proper trait bounds on generic parameters
   - Fix mismatched `impl` blocks to match trait requirements

3. **Fix Runtime Access**
   - Ensure TokioRuntime implements Clone
   - Make sure Runtime trait is properly imported when using spawn method

### Phase 2: Complete Core Implementation

Once the build issues are fixed, we'll proceed with implementing the core functionality:

1. **Builder Pattern Implementation**
   - Create proper implementation of AsyncTaskBuilder
   - Implement SpawningTaskBuilder for future-based tasks
   - Ensure builder methods follow the immutable pattern

2. **Complete AsyncTask Implementation**
   - Implement static methods for task creation
   - Connect builders to task creation process
   - Complete missing methods in trait implementations

3. **Implement Parent-Child Relationships**
   - Fix ContextualizedTask implementation
   - Ensure proper child task tracking
   - Implement cancellation propagation

4. **Task Chaining**
   - Implement chain method in SpawningTask
   - Create proper future composition for chained tasks
   - Handle error propagation in chains

### Phase 3: Event Processing

The final phase will focus on implementing event processing:

1. **Event Types**
   - Create proper event implementations
   - Implement collector for event aggregation
   - Set up event channels

2. **Processing Strategies**
   - Implement serial, parallel, and batched processing
   - Add adaptive strategy for dynamic workloads
   - Connect strategies to tasks

3. **Builder Support**
   - Complete emitting builder implementation
   - Connect to the builder pattern
   - Ensure proper event flow configuration

## Implementation Priorities

Based on our analysis, here's the prioritized order for implementation:

1. Fix build issues (critical)
2. Complete AsyncTask implementation (high)
3. Implement Builder Pattern (high)
4. Implement Parent-Child Relationships (medium)
5. Implement Task Chaining (medium)
6. Implement Event Processing (medium)

## Approach to Implementation

For each component:

1. Create tests first to validate the implementation
2. Implement core functionality
3. Ensure compatibility with the API
4. Maintain thread safety and proper error handling
5. Add comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Timeline

The estimated timeline for completion:

1. Phase 1: 1-2 days
2. Phase 2: 3-5 days
3. Phase 3: 2-3 days

Total estimated time: 6-10 days
