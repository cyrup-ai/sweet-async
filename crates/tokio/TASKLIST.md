# Tokio Implementation Task List

This document outlines the tasks needed to complete and improve the Tokio implementation of the Sweet Async API.

## Implementation Status

The current Tokio implementation is partially complete with the following components implemented:

- ✅ TokioRuntime: Basic implementation of the Runtime trait
- ✅ TokioOrchestrator: Implementation of the TaskOrchestrator trait
- ✅ TokioTask: Implementation of the AsyncTask trait
- ✅ Adaptive concurrency utilities
- ❌ Builder pattern implementation
- ❌ Event/Stream processing implementation

## High Priority Tasks

1. **Implement Builder Pattern**
   - Create TokioTaskBuilder implementing AsyncTaskBuilder
   - Implement SpawningTaskBuilder for TokioTask
   - Implement EmittingTaskBuilder for event-based tasks
   - Ensure fluent API with proper method chaining

2. **Complete the AsyncTask Implementation**
   - Implement the `to()` and `emits()` static methods in TokioTask
   - Currently these are stubbed with `unimplemented!()`

3. **Implement the ContextualizedTask Properly**
   - Fix the `runtime()` method which is currently unimplemented
   - Complete parent/child relationship tracking
   - Properly implement `child_tasks()` and `parent()` methods

4. **Complete Task Chain Implementation**
   - Implement `chain()` method in SpawningTask
   - Ensure proper chaining of operations with Future composition

5. **Complete Child Task Operations**
   - Implement `run_child()` method
   - Implement `join_children()` method

## Medium Priority Tasks

6. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Enhance error messages with more context
   - Ensure consistent error propagation
   - Add retry policies for different error types

7. **Refine Metrics Collection**
   - Improve CPU utilization tracking accuracy
   - Implement sampling-based memory tracking
   - Add network I/O metrics tracking

8. **Implement Event Processing**
   - Create TokioEventSender implementing EventSender
   - Create TokioEventReceiver implementing EventReceiver
   - Add support for different event processing strategies

9. **Add Tracing Integration**
   - Enhance TracingTask implementation with structured logging
   - Add span creation and propagation
   - Add metrics export capabilities

## Low Priority Tasks

10. **Performance Optimizations**
    - Profile and optimize task scheduling
    - Reduce lock contention in shared data structures
    - Optimize memory usage for long-running tasks

11. **Testing Framework**
    - Create comprehensive test suite for all API features
    - Add benchmarks for performance comparisons
    - Add integration tests with actual applications

12. **Documentation and Examples**
    - Add detailed API documentation
    - Create usage examples for common patterns
    - Add diagrams for architecture visualization

13. **Advanced Features**
    - Implement backpressure mechanisms for event processing
    - Add distributed task capabilities
    - Add persistence options for task state

## Implementation Notes

### Issues with Current Implementation

1. **Unimplemented Core Methods**
   - Several key methods (like `to()`, `emits()`, `runtime()`) are currently stubs
   - Child task management is incomplete
   - Task chaining functionality is missing

2. **Runtime Mixing**
   - Mix of `futures::executor::block_on` and tokio runtime methods
   - Potential for deadlocks or unexpected behavior

3. **Metrics Accuracy**
   - CPU utilization is a placeholder implementation
   - Memory tracking is not sampling actual memory usage

4. **Missing Concurrency Controls**
   - Need better handling of concurrent task operations
   - Should implement backpressure for event processing

### Architectural Considerations

1. **Builder Implementation**
   - Should follow the immutable builder pattern in the API
   - Need to ensure fluent interface with proper type safety

2. **Event Processing Model**
   - Need to implement proper event-driven task execution
   - Should support different processing strategies as in API spec

3. **Runtime Abstractions**
   - Should provide clean abstraction over tokio runtime
   - Need to handle various tokio runtime types (current_thread, multi_thread)

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a good foundation but requires significant work to complete and improve. The high priority tasks should be addressed first to ensure basic API compatibility, followed by medium and low priority tasks to enhance functionality and performance.
