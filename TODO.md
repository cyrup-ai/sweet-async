# Plan for Useful Value & Production Quality

## Pre-planner Orientation

```markdown
<thinking>
The highest level USER OBJECTIVE is to complete the tokio runtime implementation for sweet-async so that all the syntax examples in README.md work correctly with the tokio backend. The API design is complete and fully functional - the issue is my incorrect implementation in the tokio crate.
</thinking>
```

```markdown
<thinking>
MILESTONES COMPLETED:
- API design is complete and fully functional in /api/
- Basic project structure is in place
- README.md shows the intended syntax working

CURRENT MILESTONE:
- Complete the tokio runtime implementation to make all compilation errors go away
- Ensure the tokio backend properly implements all the traits defined in the API

SCOPE OF "DONE":
- All code in /tokio/src/ compiles without errors or warnings
- The tokio implementation properly supports AsyncTask::to::<T>().run(|| async { ... }).await? syntax
- cargo check --message-format short --quiet passes without any errors

WHAT WE SHOULD DEMONSTRATE:
- Basic examples from README.md work with the tokio runtime
- The .run() method properly executes async closures and returns awaitable results
</thinking>
```

## TODO Items

### Core Implementation Fixes

- [ ] **Fix AsyncResult implementation in /tokio/src/task/spawn/result.rs lines 102-150** - Replace generic AsyncResult<()> implementation with proper JoinHandle-based implementation for TokioAsyncResult<T>. Use tokio::task::JoinHandle<T> internally and implement combinators to chain operations on the handle. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer** - Rate the AsyncResult implementation work performed previously. Verify it properly wraps JoinHandle, implements all required trait methods correctly, and follows Rust best practices without unwrap() or expect() in src/.

- [ ] **Fix SpawningTask.run() method in /tokio/src/task/spawn/task.rs lines 425-428** - Currently ignores AsyncWork parameter. Must actually execute the work using tokio::spawn(), store the JoinHandle in task state, and update status to Running after spawning. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer** - Rate the SpawningTask.run() implementation. Verify it properly executes AsyncWork, handles JoinHandle correctly, and maintains proper task state transitions.

- [ ] **Fix Future implementation in /tokio/src/task/spawn/task.rs lines 471-491** - Current implementation doesn't properly poll the spawned task. Must poll the JoinHandle and return proper TokioTaskResult. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer** - Rate the Future implementation. Verify it properly polls JoinHandle, handles task completion correctly, and returns appropriate results.

- [ ] **Implement SpawningTaskBuilder trait in /tokio/src/task/spawn/builder.rs** - Complete implementation of run() method that creates TokioSpawningTask with spawned work, await_result() method that spawns and immediately awaits. Include timeout and tracing configuration. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer** - Rate the SpawningTaskBuilder implementation. Verify all trait methods are properly implemented, builder pattern works correctly, and configuration is properly applied.

### Compilation Error Resolution

- [ ] **Remove unused imports across all files in /tokio/src/** - Clean up unused imports in emit/sequence.rs line 3, emit/task.rs lines 8,10,16,26, recoverable_task.rs line 4, spawn/task.rs lines 6,12,75, task_error.rs line 5, task_relationships.rs line 3. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer** - Rate the import cleanup work. Verify all unused imports are removed while keeping necessary ones, and no compilation warnings remain.

- [ ] **Fix trait bound constraint violations** - Resolve associated type trait bound issues in AsyncResult implementation that stem from incorrect generic implementation approach. Focus on concrete implementations for specific types. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer** - Rate the trait bound fixes. Verify all trait constraints are satisfied, associated types are properly bounded, and no compilation errors remain.

### Final Verification

- [ ] **Run cargo check --message-format short --quiet** - Verify all compilation errors and warnings are resolved. Must pass without any errors or warnings. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer** - Rate the final compilation check. Verify cargo check passes cleanly, all code compiles successfully, and the tokio runtime implementation is ready for use.

- [ ] **Test basic AsyncTask::to::<T>().run() syntax** - Verify the README.md examples work with the tokio implementation. Create minimal test to prove the .run() method properly executes async closures. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer** - Rate the basic syntax testing. Verify the fundamental AsyncTask API works correctly with tokio runtime and matches the intended behavior from README.md.
